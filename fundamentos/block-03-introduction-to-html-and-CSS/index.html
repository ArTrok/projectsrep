      <h2>Facts about Stomatopoda</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to color vision, butterflies are almost at the top of the food chain.<br>
        There is one other animal that has better vision than the butterfly:<br>
        the mantis shrimp.<br>
        The mantis shrimp lives in warm, shallow water, and typically grows to be between 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) in length.<br>
        And this marvelous creature has<br>
        not two,<br>
        not three.<br>
        not five,<br>
        but SIXTEEN<br>
        color-receptive cones.<br>
        The rainbow we see stems from just THREE colors,<br>
        so try to imagine a mantis' rainbow created from SIXTEEN colors.<br>
        Where we see a rainbow.<br>
        the mantis shrimp sees a<br>
        THERMONUCLEAR BOMB of light and beauty.<br>
        Perhaps this is why they're so glorious to look at.<br>
        Being a creature who<br>
        perceives and presents such beauty,<br>
        one would expect the mantis shrimp to be some kind of undersea holy man,<br>
        gracefully floating along the sea floor, high-fiving lobsters and blessing babies.<br>
        Gentlemen! Stop this fighting at once! Your journey must be one of peace and love,<br>
        peace and love,<br>
        not violence.<br>
        Now kiss each other on the mouth.<br>
        This, however,<br>
        couldn't be further from the truth.<br>
        The truth is,<br>
        the mantis shrimp is an<br>
        Undersea<br>
        nightmare<br>
        and one of the most creatively violent<br>
        animals on earth.<br>
        it has two raptorial appendages on the front of its body.<br>
        These accelerate with the same velocity as a gunshot from a twenty-two caliber rifle,<br>
        and in less than three-thousandths<br>
        of a second can strike prey with<br>
        1,500 Newtons of force.<br>
        To put this in perspective, if human beings could accelerate our arms at Vioth that speed, we'd be able to throw a baseball into orbit.<br>
        Their limbs move so quickly the<br>
        water around them boils<br>
        in a process known as supercavitation.<br>
        When these cavitation bubbles collapse it produces an<br>
        undersea shockwave<br>
        that can kill prey even if the mantis shrimp misses its target.<br>
        The force of these collapsing bubbles also<br>
        produces temperatures in the range of several thousand Kelvins and emits<br>
        tiny bursts of light.<br>
        This effect is called sonoluminescence.<br>
        Using these "murder sticks, dismemberment<br>
        is primarily how the<br>
        mantis shrimp kills its prey.<br>
        It bashes other animals to pieces, smashing apart crabs, mollusks, oysters, and octopi until deliciousness starts squirting out.<br>
        Their limbs are so resilient, researchers have been studying their cell structure for use in the development of advanced body armor for combat troops.<br>
        Aquariums don't typically house mantis shrimps because they tend to slaughter every other creature they share a tank with<br>
        and also because they can break aquarium glass.<br>
        This is why the mantis shrimp is my new favorite animal, because in the presence of such extraordinary light and beauty it embraces<br>
        DARKNESS<br>
        It extols DEATH with the luminescent brilliance of a<br>
        DYING STAR.<br>
        It is Genghis Khan bathed in sherbet ice cream.<br>
        The mantis shrimp is the harbinger of blood-soaked rainbows.<br>
        It is bright. It is dark.<br>
        And it is beautiful.<br>
